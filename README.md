# 🌾 2024 Crop Yield Data Analysis | Power BI Project

This project presents an in-depth **Power BI dashboard** analyzing crop yield conditions across multiple regions using agricultural parameters. It provides data-driven insights into soil quality, irrigation, disease conditions, crop health, and more to help monitor and improve agricultural productivity.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The report is divided into multiple interactive dashboards with navigation via **bookmarks and buttons**:

### 1. **Home Page**
- ✅ Total Crops Monitored
- 🌿 % of Favourable Conditions
- 🌱 % of Crops With No Disease
- 🌍 Best Performing Region
- ☀️ Average NDVI Index (Crop Health)
- 💧 Average Soil Moisture %

### 2. **Soil & Irrigation Analysis**
- Soil pH, moisture distribution
- Irrigation type breakdown
- Fertilizer usage and effectiveness
- Suitability indicators by crop

### 3. **Crop Health Dashboard**
- NDVI analysis (Healthy / Moderate / Poor)
- Crop disease monitoring
- Pesticide usage patterns

### 4. **Region Analysis**
- Regional performance comparison
- Yield conditions by geography
- Environmental factor averages per region
